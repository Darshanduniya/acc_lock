I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that due to unforeseen health issues compounded by the recent long weekend, I regrettably forgot to submit my timesheet on time. As a result, I noticed that my account has been locked.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and assure you that I am taking immediate steps to rectify the situation. I understand the importance of timely submission of timesheets and acknowledge my responsibility in this matter.

Could you kindly assist me in unlocking my account so that I can promptly submit my timesheet? Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.
